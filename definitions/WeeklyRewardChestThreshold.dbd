int ID // base for WeeklyRewardActivityInfo objects. as of 34902 the thresholds are hardcoded and matched to this db by type+index. while there are multiple entries for those pairs, it seems to take the first only. thresholds by type and index: 1: [1, 5, 15], 2: [100, 150, 250], 3: [3, 7, 10]; as of 34972, thresholds are now in this table, and the server sends the id (and progress, level) to use in JamWeeklyRewardThresholdProgress
